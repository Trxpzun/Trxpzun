# Hi my name is Sherard
I am 16 soon to be 17, I attend Beecher High School. I am currently new to coding and want to evolve my skills so I can actually use the things that I have learned so that one day I would be apart of a game that was made and be able to say that I was a big help making that game.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting better at coding I'm taking one step at a time so that I can become more advanced and actually use the things I have learned. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning The different ways you can code and the different things you can do when it comes to coding. 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making one of the biggest games ever one that people would talk about for years.

- 🏈 I enjoy playing football and playing videogames because these to things are like my safe place.
